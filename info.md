# Home Assistant IHC Viewer

This is a IHC viewer custom component for Home Assistant.

[Read more about on my blog here](https://www.dingus.dk/ihc-viewer-for-home-assistant/)

To use it, in the configuration.yaml file insert this:

```yaml
ihcviewer:
```

And you will of course need to have IHC configured in Home Assistant before hand.

You will get a new menu item:

And you can view your IHC project:
